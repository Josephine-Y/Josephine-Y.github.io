            In the first semester of first-year Engineering Science, I worked in a team of three for a 
            Civil Engineering course, CIV 102 Structures and Materials. Our objective was to apply the 
            knowledge we had gained in the course to design and construct a bridge using a 32" x 40" x 0.05" 
            sheet of Matboard and two tubes of concrete cement. My team iterated through multiple designs 
            by analyzing the data gained from digitally calculated stress on various areas of the bridge 
            under bending. We then constructed the bridge, also requiring optimization in the form of 
            cutting the board such that all required pieces were obtained from the rectangular sheet we 
            were provided. To conclude the project, we tested the load that our bridge—Trussworthy—could 
            withstand using the teaching team's apparatus.
