        <p>
            In the first semester of first-year Engineering Science, I worked in a team of five for an 
            Engineering Design course, ESC 101 Praxis I. The main project was to identify a Splartz—a 
            minor inconvenience—within the first-year Engineering Science community and recommend a 
            design for a solution. My team worked on addressing the opportunity of stray eggshell 
            fragments contaminating egg contents after cracking a raw egg for consumption. This Splartz 
            resonated with us as we had all experienced the frustration associated with removing tiny 
            eggshell fragments when preparing eggs. At the end of the term, we produced a design report 
            that compared our final design to alternatives, supporting our recommendation with evidence 
            from testing and research.
